To limit the number of larger .ONNX files stored on git,
the most up to date model should be copied to a file name model_GIT.onnx and included in the version stored on git.

Each time a new model_GIT.onnx is pushed to git, the date
(MM/DD/YYY) and model version copied should be recorded here:

Version stored as model_GIT.onnx:

model2_2_2.onnx, copied 04/15/2024

Other versions can be found on Wasabi in their respective dataset folders.
